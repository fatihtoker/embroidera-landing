I want you to build a complete, modern, responsive **Next.js** website for my handmade crafts and workshops business.

### Description:
I create and sell all kinds of handmade crafts and organize creative workshops.
The website should present my work, my story, and allow visitors to register for workshops or send feedback.
The entire site must support **three languages**: English, Dutch, and Turkish.
The language should be automatically detected based on the user’s browser or location, but visitors must also be able to switch languages manually via a language selector (e.g., a dropdown or flag icons).

---

### Website Structure:
1. **Cover Section (Hero)** – A modern, eye-catching hero section with my name, tagline, and a simple responsive navigation bar.
2. **About Me** – A section introducing me, my creative philosophy, and a few photos.
3. **Portfolio** – A grid-style gallery of my handmade works, with images and short captions (easy to update later).
4. **Workshops** – A list of current and upcoming workshops.
- Each workshop should have its **own registration form**, including fields: name, email, phone, selected workshop/date, and an optional message.
5. **Contact / Feedback** – A simple contact and feedback form for general inquiries or suggestions.

### Design & Style Requirements:
- A **minimal, elegant, and original** design that reflects the theme of handmade art.
- Use **natural and calm colors** (beige, soft terracotta, light green, off-white).
- Fully **responsive** (desktop, tablet, and mobile).
- Smooth, subtle animations for transitions or hover effects.
- Elegant, readable typography (Playfair Display, Lora, or Inter).
- Include a consistent layout with a header, footer, and language switcher available on all pages.

---

### Technical & Structural Requirements:
- Use **Next.js (latest version)** with **App Router** and **React components**.
- Implement **internationalization (i18n)** with libraries such as `next-intl`, `next-i18next`, or `react-intl`.
- Detect user locale automatically and load the corresponding language by default.
- Allow manual language switching (the user’s choice should persist).
- Each text string (section titles, labels, etc.) should be stored in translation files for `en`, `nl`, and `tr`.
- Use a **modular and scalable** folder structure:
- `/components` for sections (Hero, About, Portfolio, Workshops, Contact)
- `/locales` for translation files (`en.json`, `nl.json`, `tr.json`)
- `/public` for images and static assets
- Use **Tailwind CSS** or **Styled Components** for styling.
- Forms should have working validation; submission logic can be dummy/local but structured for future backend integration.
- Code must be **well-documented and commented**, so I can add or modify sections easily.
- The project should run properly in the **Replit environment**.

### Output:
- Generate a complete and runnable Next.js project with multilingual support.
- Include example translations in all three languages for all sections.
- Start the development server so I can preview it live on Replit.
